# Employee Salary Prediction

## Project Overview

This repository contains a data science project that predicts employee salaries using advanced machine learning techniques. The project demonstrates a complete workflow from exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation, all within interactive Jupyter Notebooks. The goal is to provide reliable salary predictions based on employee attributes, and to showcase best practices in machine learning for tabular data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to employees, such as:
- Age
- Education level
- Years of experience
- Job title
- Department
- Location
- Previous salary (if available)
- Other relevant attributes

Ensure you have the dataset in the `data/` directory. If not, update the notebook to point to your file location.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA is performed to:
- Summarize data statistics
- Visualize distributions and relationships (e.g., salary vs experience)
- Detect missing values and outliers
- Understand feature correlations

Plots and summary tables are included in the Jupyter Notebook to help you understand the data before modeling.

## Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Steps include:
- Handling missing values (e.g., using mean/median imputation or dropping records)
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., One-Hot, Label Encoding)
- Feature scaling (Standardization or Normalization)
- Engineering new features (e.g., experience buckets, job seniority levels)
- Splitting the data into training and test sets

## Modeling

The project experiments with several machine learning models, such as:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost)
- Support Vector Regression

Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV) may be used to optimize model performance.

## Evaluation

Models are evaluated using regression metrics like:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

Results are compared across models, and the best-performing one is selected for final predictions.

## Visualization

The notebook includes:
- Feature importance plots
- Residual analysis
- Actual vs Predicted salary plots
- Correlation heatmaps

These help interpret the model and communicate results.

## Usage

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sagarbunker26/Employee-Salary-Prediction---SAGAR-BUNKER.git
cd Employee-Salary-Prediction---SAGAR-BUNKER
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Step 4: Run the analysis

- Open the main notebook in the `notebooks/` folder.
- Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook cells.
- You may need to update the data path if your dataset location differs.

### Step 5: Model Training & Prediction

- Modify parameters or algorithms as needed.
- Re-run cells to retrain or test new models.
- Use the provided code to make predictions on new employee data.
